This guide will take users through installation of R in a new Anaconda virtual environment. I always recommend biologists use Anaconda for managing R and its dependencies, because it gives us access to the Bioconda channel. The Bioconda channel is an incredibly powerful hub for many of the most important bioinformatic software. Not only does it consolidate the packages into a single channel, it manages version dependencies between them.

Any software stack that can be built with Anaconda can be replicated on any other similar system with ease. Reproduce-ability of environments and results is a must for biological research in the computer age.

We will make frequent mention of Python in this guide. This is because, at its core, Anaconda is a virtualizer for Python. There is a close relationship between Python and R in the biology community, so they are managed simultaneously by Anaconda. The principles in this guide can be similarly applied to creating Python environments. See the relevant section of the related guide in this repository on installing Python.
