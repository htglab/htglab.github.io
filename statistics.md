### Course Description
This is an introductory course to statistics and R programming for VNUK students. The material is offered in 6 consecutive modules (please see Course Syllabus below), each containing a lecture and practicum in a tutorial class. For practical exercises, we will use the R programming language and R Studio. The R part is offered in 4 slow-paced practicums for beginners. However, this course is focused on statistics rather than R; therefore, each practicum is designed with the purpose to demonstrate and reinforce understanding of concepts introduced in the lecture rather than to provide training in R.
