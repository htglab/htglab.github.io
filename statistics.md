### Course Description
This introductory course to statistics and probability theory is given to VNUK students. The material is offered in 5 consecutive modules (please see Course Syllabus below), each containing a lecture and a practicum in a tutorial class. For practical exercises, we will use the R programming language and R Studio. However, this course is focused on statistics rather than R; therefore, each practicum is designed with the purpose to demonstrate and reinforce understanding of concepts introduced in the lecture rather than to provide training in R.
### Course Syllabus, Schedule, and Materials
#### MODULE 1. Introduction to R. 
LECTURE 1. slides.
PRACTICUM I. Intro to R and R Studio.
Introduction to R studio: explore environment variable, navigate the history of commands, navigate directory and file structure, workspace, and files.
Simple arithmetic in R console.
Create and delete an object.
Introduction to data types and the "vector" data structure.
Create and run a short script.
Read and write a file.
OUTCOME: Write a script that creates (and enters) a directory, processes a simple manipulation, and write into a file.
Slides day1
Exercises day1
Correction for exercise 1, exercise 2, exercise 3


PRACTICUM II. Data structures in R. 
More on vectors and factors.
Matrices and data frames: create, access/extract/subset, modify, arithmetic, conversions, check, and name dimensions.
OUTCOME: Produce a script that reads matrices and data frames, manipulates them, read, and write files.
Slides day2
Exercises day2

PRACTICUM III. Lists & Packages. 
More on data structures. Lists: create, access/extract/subset, modify.
Packages: find, install, load, explore/find functions and documentation, get help on functions.
OUTCOME: Install the packages "diamonds" and "WriteXLS". Use them in a script that manipulates the diamonds data frame and writes it into an Excel file.
