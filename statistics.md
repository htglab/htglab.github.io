#### Course Description
This is an introductory course to statistics and R programming for VNUK students. The material is offered in 6 modules, each containing a lecture and practicum in tutorial class. For practical exercises, we will use the R programming language and R Studio (with interface). The R part is offered in 2 slow-paced practicums for beginners. However, this course is focused on statistics rather than R; therefore, each practicum is designed with the purpose to demonstrate and reinforce understanding of concepts introduced in the lecture rather than to provide training in R. (Syllabus)

#### MODULE 1. Introduction Statistics and basic R
LECTURE 1.1: Basic Statistical Concept. Intro R and Rstudio
