#### Course Description
This is an introductory course to statistics and R programming for VNUK students. The material is offered in 6 modules, each containing a lecture and practicum in tutorial class. For practical exercises, we will use the R programming language and R Studio (with interface). The R part is offered in 4 slow-paced practicums for beginners. However, this course is focused on statistics rather than R; therefore, each practicum is designed with the purpose to demonstrate and reinforce understanding of concepts introduced in the lecture rather than to provide training in R. 

#### MODULE 1. Introduction to R
LECTURE 1. 
What is R and why to use R? Basics of R language. Data types. Data structures.

TUTORIAL 1.1. Intro to R and R Studio.

TUTORIAL 1.2. Data structures in R. 

TUTORIAL 1.3. Lists & Packages. 

TUTORIAL 1.4. Plots & Graphics in R. 

#### MODULE 2. Descriptive statistics
LECTURE 2. 
Exploratory data analysis: bar-plot, histogram, CDF, box-plot, scatter-plot, pie charts etc. Samples, measures of center and spread, percentiles, odds ratio. Outliers and robustness. Experiment versus observational study, confounding factors, simple random sample, other types of sampling, biases in sampling techniques.

LECTURE 3. 
Introduction to R programming language and R Studio: Data types, variables, packages, functions, handling files/scripts/projects.

TUTORIAL 2. Basic plots in R using the ggplot2 package.

#### MODULE 3. Introduction to Probability
LECTURE 3. 
Independence, conditional probability, Bayes formula. Distributions, population mean and population variance, Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distribution. Central Limit theorem and the Law of large numbers. Continuity correction. Sampling with and without replacement. Correction for finite population size.

TUTORIAL 3. Elementary probability problems in R, Probability Density Function and the Cumulative Distribution Function, simulation explicating the law of large numbers.

#### MODULE 4. Statistical Inference, part I.
LECTURE 4
Statistical Inference, part I. The concept of hypothesis testing, type I and type II error, false discovery rate. Significance and confidence level, p-value. Confidence intervals. One-sided and two-sided tests and confidence intervals. Sampling distribution, estimators, standard error. Normal probabilities in application to p-value. One-sample and two-sample tests for independent and matched samples with known variance. The case of unknown variance and Student t-distribution, assumption of normality. Pooled variance and equal variances assumption..

TUTORIAL 4. One- and two-sample tests with known and unknown variance, test for proportions, simulation involving confidence intervals and t-distribution.

#### MODULE 5. Statistical Inference, part II. 
LECTURE 5. 
Statistical Inference, part II. Estimation of variance. Fisher test for variance equality. Non-parametric tests. Sign test, Wilcoxon sum of ranks test (Mann-Whitney U-test), Wilcoxon signed rank test. Chi-square test for goodness of fit, chi-square test for independence. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Shapiro test for normality. Sample size estimation. Correction for multiple testing, family-wise error rate.

TUTORIAL 5. Tests with unknown variance, non-parametric tests, simulations explicating non-parametric tests, FDR.

#### MODULE 6. Statistical modeling, Regression.
LECTURE 6. 
Simple linear regression model, residuals, degrees of freedom, least squares method, correlation coefficient, variance decomposition, determination coefficient. Interpretation of the slope, correlation, and determination coefficients. Standard error and statistical inference in simple linear regression model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA). One-way and two-way ANOVA.

TUTORIAL 6. Problems on linear regression, ANOVA, data transformation.
